# CF-OCT-segmentation
This repository contains the code for the semantic segmentation and quantification of cochlear fibrosis (CF) in a novel **Cochlear Fibrosis OCT** dataset (animal models). We hope that our findings will advance future studies on exploring the relationship between cochlear fibrosis and residual hearing loss, development of cochlear implants (CI) or treatment of EAS-patients.

We benchmark different Keras segmentation models on our new **Cochlear Fibrosis OCT** dataset:

Proposed 2D-OCT-UNET

**Fig. 1.** Block diagram of the proposed 2D-OCT-UNET architecture for the multiclass OCT segmentation used in this work. The very deep 2D-
OCT-UNET processes two-dimensional OCT slices and consists of seven encoder-decoder blocks with skip connections. The numbers above the
encoder, bottleneck and decoder blocks indicate the number of filters in the convolutional Conv2D layers. GN stands for Group Normalization layers
with the number of groups parameter ng = 2. The input resolution of the UNET is set to be 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels. We include Dropout(0.1) layers
only in the decoder. The number of filters in the last Conv2D layer is equal to the nc = 4 (number of classes).

Other models included are: VGG16-UNET, UEfficientNet, SegFormer and MST-DeepLabv3

## Implementation Details
All semantic segmentation models (except SAM) were implemented in Python 3.9.12, Tensorflow 2.9.1 and Keras 2.9.0. The SAM model was implemented in Python 3.9.12 and PyTorch 2.0.1 (cu117). All experiments were performed on a desktop computer with the Ubuntu operating system 18.04.3 LTS with the Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, and a total of 62GB RAM.

## Training
Use _OHSU_UNET_cochlear_multiclass_4paper.py_ to train the proposed 2D-OCT-UNET, UEfficientNet, VGG16-UNET and the MST-DeepLabv3 models.
Use _OHSU_UNET_cochlear_multiclass_Segformer_4paper.py_ to train the SegFormer model.
Select models by commenting/uncommenting lines 99-106 in _OHSU_UNET_cochlear_multiclass_4paper.py_
Update _dataloader.py_ (rescale part) for individual models being used.

## Quantification of Fibrosis
The code for the quantification of Fibrosis is embedded into _OHSU_UNET_cochlear_multiclass_4paper.py_ and _OHSU_UNET_cochlear_multiclass_Segformer_4paper.py_.
The code will compute the amount of fibrosis for the raw volumes OCTV1L, OCTV7L, OCTV9L, OCTV10L and OCTV11L.
